# Through the Time Lens: Your Age Revisited

Through the Time Lens is a Python-based web application I built using Streamlit that aims to provide users with fun and interesting insights about their age in various contexts. It presents a unique perspective on your age - from what your age would be on different planets, who was the US President when you were born, to the value of a dollar at your birth.

You can access the app through the following link:
https://your-age-insights.streamlit.app/

## Installation and Running

The web app requires several libraries to be installed. The required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. 

You can install the necessary libraries by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the application, navigate to the directory containing the app files and run the following command:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## Data Sources

The application makes use of multiple data sources in CSV format that are included in `Data` folder. Original data can be accessed through the links on the app.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to all the Python community and in particular the Streamlit team for creating such a versatile tool for rapid web app development.
